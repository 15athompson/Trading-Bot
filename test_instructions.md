# Testing Instructions

To test the implemented security improvements, follow these steps:

1. Install the updated requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
     BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
     SSL_CERTFILE=path_to_your_ssl_certificate
     SSL_KEYFILE=path_to_your_ssl_key
     ```

3. Obtain SSL certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt) and update the SSL_CERTFILE and SSL_KEYFILE environment variables with the correct paths.

4. Run the bot:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Test the rate limiting by making multiple requests to the `/api/trade` endpoint within a short time frame. You can use a tool like cURL or Postman to send repeated requests and observe the rate limiting behavior.

6. Verify that the bot is running over HTTPS by accessing the web interface at `https://localhost:5000`. Make sure your browser shows a secure connection.

7. Check the `app.log` file to ensure that comprehensive logging is working correctly. You should see detailed log entries for various operations performed by the bot.

8. Review the `security_audit.md` file and start implementing the security audit checklist. Go through each item and ensure that it's properly addressed in your project.

By following these steps, you can verify that the security improvements have been correctly implemented and are functioning as expected.
