
Enhanced Trading System Project Description

Overview:
Developed an Enhanced Trading System, a comprehensive trading bot leveraging advanced machine learning models and financial analysis techniques to optimize trading strategies and manage risk in financial markets. The system incorporates regime detection, predictive modeling, portfolio optimization, stress testing, and regulatory compliance checks to ensure robust performance and adherence to market regulations.

Key Features:

Market Data Fetching and Preprocessing:

Utilized Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical data for multiple financial symbols.
Preprocessed data by calculating returns, log returns, volatility, and various technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, ATR, Bollinger Bands, OBV, ADX, and MFI.
Market Regime Detection:

Implemented market regime detection using Random Forest Classifier based on technical indicators to classify market conditions as bullish or bearish.
Added Bollinger Band squeeze detection and trend strength indicators (ADX) for enhanced regime analysis.
Predictive Modeling:

Developed and trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for price prediction using TensorFlow, capturing temporal dependencies in stock prices.
Trained GARCH models for volatility prediction, providing insights into future market fluctuations.
Portfolio Optimization:

Applied Modern Portfolio Theory using the Efficient Frontier from PyPortfolioOpt to optimize asset allocation, maximizing the Sharpe ratio and ensuring a balanced portfolio.
Conducted risk management through value-at-risk (VaR) calculations and stress testing with simulated scenarios.
Strategy Execution:

Developed a trading strategy based on predictive signals from LSTM and regime models, executing trades via Alpaca API.
Implemented high-performance trade execution with multithreading to manage multiple symbols concurrently.
Stress Testing:

Generated stressed data scenarios and assessed the trading strategy's robustness under adverse market conditions.
Calculated performance metrics such as mean return, VaR(95%), and CVaR(95%) from stress test results.
Regulatory Compliance:

Conducted comprehensive compliance checks, including position limits, wash sales, trade reporting, insider trading patterns, and market manipulation detection.
Maintained a detailed log of all operations and trade activities for audit purposes.
Continuous Monitoring and Alerts:

Implemented continuous market data monitoring, real-time position reevaluation, and risk limit checks.
Configured alerts for significant events such as drawdown breaches, high volatility, and liquidity issues, with email notifications for critical alerts.
Technical Stack:

Libraries & Tools: Numpy, Pandas, yFinance, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, TA-Lib, PyPortfolioOpt, Arch, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Alpaca API, ThreadPoolExecutor.
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Classifier, LSTM, GARCH.
Optimization & Risk Management: Efficient Frontier, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).
Outcome:
The Enhanced Trading System demonstrated the ability to effectively manage and optimize a trading portfolio by combining predictive modeling, regime detection, and advanced risk management techniques. It provided a robust framework for automated trading while adhering to regulatory standards, ensuring sustainable and compliant trading operations.
