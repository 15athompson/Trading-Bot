# To Do

## Run the Application
1. Open a terminal and execute the following command:
   ```sh
   python crypto_trading_bot/main.py
   ```

## Test HTTPS Access
1. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000).
   - You will see a security warning due to the self-signed certificate. Accept the warning and proceed.
   - If you see a "Not Found" page, it is expected as the root URL route is not defined.

## Test Rate Limiting
1. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send multiple POST requests to:
   ```sh
   https://localhost:5000/api/trade
   ```
   - You can make up to 10 requests per minute. After that, a `429 "Rate limit exceeded"` error will be returned.

## Check Logging
1. After running the application and performing some actions, check the contents of the `app.log` file.
   - The log entries will include timestamps, trade requests, rate limit warnings, and any errors.

2. To view the log file, use the following command:
   ```sh
   type crypto_trading_bot\app.log
   ```
   - Replace `type` with `cat` if using a Unix-based system.
