# Security Audit Checklist

## Regular Security Audits

- [ ] Schedule quarterly security audits
- [ ] Review and update security policies and procedures
- [ ] Perform vulnerability assessments
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Review access controls and user permissions
- [ ] Audit logging and monitoring systems
- [ ] Review incident response and disaster recovery plans

## Automated Vulnerability Scanning and Dependency Checking

- [ ] Set up automated vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nessus)
- [ ] Implement dependency checking tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk)
- [ ] Configure automated scans to run weekly
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Regularly review and address scan results

## Comprehensive Logging

- [ ] Implement logging for all critical operations
- [ ] Log all access attempts (successful and failed)
- [ ] Use a centralized logging system
- [ ] Implement log rotation and retention policies
- [ ] Regularly review logs for suspicious activities

## Environment Variables for Sensitive Data

- [ ] Store all sensitive configuration data in environment variables
- [ ] Use a .env file for local development (ensure it's in .gitignore)
- [ ] Use secure environment variable management for production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

## Regular Dependency Updates

- [ ] Set up automated dependency update notifications (e.g., Dependabot)
- [ ] Review and test dependency updates weekly
- [ ] Maintain a dependency update log

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- [ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for database operations
- [ ] Sanitize all outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Secure Headers

- [ ] Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Set X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- [ ] Use Content-Security-Policy header
- [ ] Set X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing
- [ ] Use X-XSS-Protection header

## SSL/TLS Configuration

- [ ] Use strong SSL/TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 and above)
- [ ] Configure secure cipher suites
- [ ] Implement OCSP stapling
- [ ] Use HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) for critical services

## Rate Limiting

- [ ] Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity
- [ ] Implement gradual backoff for repeated failures

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication for critical operations
- [ ] Use JWT with appropriate expiration for API authentication
- [ ] Implement proper session management

## Error Handling

- [ ] Implement custom error pages
- [ ] Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Log all errors for review

## Third-Party Integrations

- [ ] Regularly review and audit third-party integrations
- [ ] Implement proper API key management for third-party services
- [ ] Monitor third-party service usage and set up alerts for abnormal behavior

## Data Encryption

- [ ] Implement encryption at rest for sensitive data
- [ ] Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256)
- [ ] Implement proper key management

## Backup and Recovery

- [ ] Implement regular automated backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration process regularly
- [ ] Store backups securely, preferably off-site

## Code Review

- [ ] Implement mandatory code review process
- [ ] Use static code analysis tools
- [ ] Conduct regular security-focused code reviews

## Server Hardening

- [ ] Keep server operating systems and software up to date
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules
- [ ] Use intrusion detection/prevention systems
- [ ] Regularly audit server configurations

## Documentation

- [ ] Maintain up-to-date security documentation
- [ ] Document all security-related processes and procedures
- [ ] Provide security training materials for developers

Remember to review and update this checklist regularly as new security best practices emerge and your system evolves.
