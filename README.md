# Advanced Crypto Trading Bot

This project contains both a simple and an advanced cryptocurrency trading bot that use the CCXT library to interact with multiple exchanges. The bots implement various trading strategies, risk management techniques, and machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Features

### Simple Bot (main.py)
- Connects to Binance futures market
- Fetches historical price data for BTC/USDT
- Calculates fast (20-period) and slow (50-period) Simple Moving Averages
- Generates buy and sell signals based on SMA crossovers
- Runs continuously, checking for new signals every hour

### Advanced Bot (advanced_bot.py)
- Supports multiple exchanges (Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase Pro)
- Supports multiple cryptocurrency pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, ADA/USDT)
- Implements multiple trading strategies (Moving Average Crossover and RSI)
- Incorporates machine learning models for price prediction
- Advanced risk management with position sizing and stop-loss/take-profit
- Portfolio management with real-time updates
- Backtesting functionality for strategy evaluation
- Real-time market data streaming
- Logging and performance tracking

### Web Interface (web_interface.py)
- User-friendly web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling the trading bot
- Real-time portfolio updates and visualization
- Start/stop bot functionality
- Backtest runner with customizable date range

### Security Enhancements
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive logging for auditing and troubleshooting
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Regular security audits (see security_audit.md)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `config.py` and replace the placeholder API keys and secrets with your actual credentials for Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase Pro.
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
     BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
     SSL_CERTFILE=path_to_your_ssl_certificate
     SSL_KEYFILE=path_to_your_ssl_key
     ```

## Usage

### Simple Bot
Run the simple bot using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

### Advanced Bot
Run the advanced bot using the following command:

```
python advanced_bot.py
```

### Web Interface
To start the web interface, run the following command:

```
python web_interface.py
```

Then open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5000` to access the dashboard.
