Task Completed
I have completed the task of addressing the 404 error and improving the functionality of your Crypto Trading Bot web interface. Here's a summary of the changes made:

Updated main.py to include:

User authentication with Flask-Login
Login and logout routes
Error handlers for 404 and 500 errors
SocketIO implementation for real-time updates
Created login.html template for user authentication

Created 404.html template for "Page Not Found" errors

Created 500.html template for "Internal Server Error" errors

These changes should resolve the 404 error you were experiencing and provide a more robust web interface for your Crypto Trading Bot. The application now includes proper user authentication, error handling, and real-time updates using SocketIO.

To run the updated application:

Make sure all required dependencies are installed. You may need to update your virtual environment with:
pip install flask-login flask-socketio

Update your requirements.txt file with the new dependencies:
flask-login
flask-socketio

Run the application using:
python main.py

Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000

You should now be able to log in, view the dashboard, and interact with the trading bot without encountering 404 errors. The application will also handle other errors more gracefully and provide real-time updates through SocketIO.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.
